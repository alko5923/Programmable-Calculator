Symbolic Calculator
Author: Aljaz Kovac (alko5923) and Leo Arnholm

What is it?
This is a Symbolic Calculator, an easy tool to use if you'd like to write your own 
mathematical functions and perform calculations. Here is an example of how you would 
implement a simple factorial function: 

function factorial(n)
  n - 1 = m
  if n > 1 {factorial(m) * n} else {1}
end

How to use? 
Type "make all" in a Linux-compatible terminal, followed by "make run". 

Important!
Functions must have at least one argument. Functions have their own scope, meaning
that any variables decleared within functions will not be seen globally.
